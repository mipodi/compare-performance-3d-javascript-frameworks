# Performance in 3D on the Web
## Comparing Babylon.js with Three.js

This repo is part of a bachelor thesis in software engineering. Here are the two apps compared as well as the performance data in the form of memory snapshots and JSON files. To read more about the context, see the thesis here: [will be added]

The setup in the respective app folders are created to be as similar as possible. The only files placed on Netlify were the index.html and the index.js that ends up in the build folder once you have built each project with ```npm run build```.

If you want to look into the performance data more closely, download the files. Then open Firefox and developer tools. Drag for example the memory file to the memory tab and it will open the same visual interface as would have shown if you had recorded the file yourself.
